 * kernel_test.c
 * Scheduled tasks Test: micro kernel test that runs scheduled tasks.
 * This kernel uses a hardware timer that is set in the avrio-board-kernel.h file.
 * It generates a periodic interrupt (every millisecond mostly) and allows to
 * perform shared tasks with a round-robin organization.
 * Here the task toggle the state of an LED every 50 milliseconds, a global
 * variable is used to disable the task every second.
 * This program checks the setting of the  hardware timer.
